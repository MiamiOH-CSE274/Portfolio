7 - Create an implementation of a Queue
----

To show suffecient knowledge of Queue I will use my 03_Queue_Lab the link is https://github.com/kosirjm/03_Queue_Lab

You can see demonstration of the test code working at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWNuNIQbCug

7 - Create an implementation of a List
----

To show suffecient knowledge of a List I will use my 04_Linked_List_Lab the link is https://github.com/kosirjm/04_Linked_List_Lab

You can see demonstration of the test code working at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-BxVjXBI6Y8

7 - Create an implementation of a Binary Search Tree
----

To show suffecient knowledge of a List I will use my 06_BST_Lab the link is https://github.com/kosirjm/06_BST_Lab

You can see demonstration of the test code working at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv2G1KAsAvo

7 - Create an implementaiton of a Hash Table
----
Possible sources of evidence (do any one of these):

* https://github.com/MiamiOH-CSE274/05_Hashing_Lab
* Use a hash table in the Zeitgeist project
* Use locality-preserving hashing on the Starbucks project (not recommended!)
* Consult with Dr. Brinkman on an alternative project

7 - Create an implementation of a Heap
----

To show suffecient knowledge of a List I will use my 07_heap_Lab the link is https://github.com/kosirjm/07_Heap_Lab

You can see demonstration of the test code working at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_U_GRiGsd0o

7 - Create an implementation of either Adjanency Lists or Adjacency Matrices
----
Possible sources of evidence (do any one of these):

* Graph lab
* Graph Algorithms lab
* Graph project
* Consult with Dr. Brinkman on an alternative project

7 - Implement graph algorithms
----
Possible sources of evidence (do any one of these):

* Graph lab
* Graph Algorithms lab
* Graph project
* Consult with Dr. Brinkman on an alternative project

21 - Determine space and time requirements of common data structure methods
-----
Possible sources of evidence (do up to 3 of these, up to 7 points for each):

* Select any of the following labs, and analyze the running times for each of your methods of your data structure: <b> Queue </b> , Linked List, Binary Search Tree, Heap, Hash Table, Graph (Adjacency List or Adjacency Matrix, you don't have to do both, but you can if you want)

Only One currently done is the Queue Lab.  Please see https://github.com/kosirjm/03_Queue_Lab

5 - Describe memory management in C++, and correctly use dynamic variables, including destructors
----
Possible sources of evidence (do one):

* Select any of your labs or projects that uses dynamic memory, and explain how memory is managed. In particular, you must show that your program does not leak memory, and does not suffer from dangling pointers or out of bounds array access. This will probably require referring to your code, providing links.

Though I have done this in my Queue_Lab I would like to work with this more, and understand it better before submitting this question.  I could currently give a general answer from what we have learned, but I would like to get a better feel for it first. 
5 - Create collection classes using templates in C++
----
Possible sources of evidence (do one):

* Any of the labs or projects, provided it uses templates in an interesting way.


30 - Using time and space analysis, justify the selection of a data structure for a given application
----

Possible sources of evidence (do up to 2 of these, up to 15 points for each):

* Select a project for which there are multiple reasonable data structure designs. Describe two reasonable options, and explain the trade-offs between them. For each, describe an application where the data structure would be better. For example, if comparing KD-Trees to a Grid in the Starbucks problem, which one is better really depends on the input data set. Explain what the data would have to look like for the Grid to be a clear winner, and also what type of data would lead you to use a KD-Tree instead.
