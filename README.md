Portfolio
=========
Document completion of the course's learning outcomes.

Instructions
====
The goal of this is to make it very easy for me (or an employer, or a teaching assistant) to see whether or not you have mastered the material of the class. The hope is that I would be able to grade your work without downloading and compiling your code. For labs, I can grade them by inspecting the code. For projects you must provide a video demonstrations of your programs. Some questions require essay responses.

Important
=========
If you prefer, you may turn this in to me via email, instead of hosting it on GitHub. Please talk to me about it during office hours or before or after class.

Body of portfolio

7 - Create an implementation of a Queue
----
https://github.com/samsab/03_Queue_Lab

7 - Create an implementation of a List
----
https://github.com/samsab/04_Linked_List_Lab

7 - Determine space and time requirements of common data structure methods
-----
TODO: For each pair of data structures listed here, write a short essay comparing and contrasting them in terms of their running times for different operations. (7 points each)

* Array-based list vs. Linked List


5 - Describe memory management in C++, and correctly use dynamic variables, including destructors
----
TODO: Define/describe each of the following terms, as they apply to memory management in C++

* The call stack (not to be confused with the stack data structure!)


* The heap (not to be confused with the heap data structure!)


* Address


* Pointer


TODO: Answer the following questions about memory management and dynamic variables

* What is a memory leak, and why is it bad?


* What is a dangling pointer (or dangling reference), and why is it dangerous?


* What is a destructor, and why are they necessary (in C++) to prevent memory leaks? Why *aren't* they necessary in Java?


5 - Using time and space analysis, justify the selection of a data structure for a given application
----
TODO: Answer the following questions about choosing data structures. (5 points each)

* If I needed a data structure to store a grocery list, which data structure (or data structures) that we learned this semester would be most appropriate? Carefully explain why.
I believe an ArrayList would be most advantageous to storing a grocery list. It's easy to add in items which we need, and just as easy to pop them out as we get the items on the list. It's the simplest way to make a basic list, such as one for groceries.
