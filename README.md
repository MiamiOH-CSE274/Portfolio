Portfolio
=========
Document completion of the course's learning outcomes.

Instructions
====
The goal of this is to make it very easy for me (or an employer, or a teaching assistant) to see whether or not you have mastered the material of the class. The hope is that I would be able to grade your work without downloading and compiling your code. For labs, I can grade them by inspecting the code. For projects you must provide a video demonstrations of your programs. Some questions require essay responses.

Important
=========
If you prefer, you may turn this in to me via email, instead of hosting it on GitHub. Please talk to me about it during office hours or before or after class.

21 - Determine space and time requirements of common data structure methods
-----

* Array-based list vs. Linked List
	Array-based lists and Linked lists each have their pros and cons. First off, the array-based list has quick set() and get()
	methods, each with a running time of O(1). This is because the array can quickly be told to look something up using the
	number that corresponds with that elements spot in the array. The array, however, takes a lot longer to do the add() and 
	remove() methods if the array is supposed to be ordered in some way. These methods take O(n) time. This is because in order
	for the array to put the element in the proper spot or remove an element from a certain spot, it may have to move quite a 
	few of the other elements in the array. Also, the array may need to be resized as arrays' sizes need to be specified upon
	creation. Linked lists on the other hand are much slower at the get() and set() functions. This is because linked lists
	need to travel from the beginning of the list every time to find a certain element in the list. This gives those methods
	O(n) time. Linked lists also need O(n) time to add and remove elements unless you use an iterator. One of the benefits of
	a linked list is that you don't need to resize it because it is dynamic. This makes it easier when adding a very large number
	of elements to the list. When comparing memory space for both, a linked list will take up more space because it has to keep
	track of the element's data as well as the pointers to the previous element and the next element whereas the array just keeps
	track of where the element is in the list and the data corresponding with that element.


* Binary Search Tree vs. Hash Table
	Hash tables are usually faster than binary search tress. Hash tables can do get() set() and remove() all in O(1) time. Binary
	search trees require O(log n) time for those same functions. The hash table requires more space, however, as it typically needs
	2x as much to avoid two elements hashing to the same spot. This still does not rule out the possibility of a collision to occur,
	in which case the running times for the hash table can increase dramatically. This all depends upon the hash function for the
	table and using a decent size. Binary search trees on the other hand only use enough space needed to hold all of the items in
	the tree. The binary search tree also has the advantage of all of its items being sorted, so it makes it quicker to retrieve
	the items within the tree all in order. This also allows for the next() and prev() operations to be quicker since the tree
	is already sorted.

* Adjacency List vs. Adjacency Matrix
	An adjacency matrix is good for finding whether or not a specific adjacecy exists. To do this, all you have to do is go to
	the element that represents the adjacency in the matrix and get the boolean that tells you whether or not it exists. Theproblem
	with adjacency matrixes is that they take up a lot of space. The matrix has to store all possible adjacencies. The list on the
	other hand only needs to hold all the existing adjacencies. A matrix can get a specific adjacency in O(1) time while a list has
	the worst case ofO(n) time, so a matrix is faster but potentially takes up a lot more space.


5 - Describe memory management in C++, and correctly use dynamic variables, including destructors
----

* The call stack (not to be confused with the stack data structure!)
	The call stack allows for fast access of memory. It stores all statically allocated variables and info related to function calls.
	For example,  parameters and return addresses.

* The heap (not to be confused with the heap data structure!)
	This stores all dynamically allocated memeory and requires manual memory management. For example, any variable allocated with
	the new keyword will be stored here.

* Address
	This is the physical location of a variable in memory.

* Pointer
	A pointer is a variable that holds a memory address. Using the address of an object, you can easily see what is stored there.


* What is a memory leak, and why is it bad?
	A memory leak is an item in memory that no longer has any pointers to it. It is bad because it is occupying memory space that
	could be freed for other resources. This waste of valuable resources in the worst case might cause a crash in your system, or
	simply slow it down.

* What is a dangling pointer (or dangling reference), and why is it dangerous?
	A dangling pointer occurs when you deallocate an object without dereferencing it. The pointer that used to point to that object
	still points to the memory location of that deallocated object. This can lead to unexcpected behaviour in your program or even
	potential crashes.

* What is a destructor, and why are they necessary (in C++) to prevent memory leaks? Why *aren't* they necessary in Java?
	A destructor is a method that is used in C++ to destroy in object that is no longer needed for whatever reason. This deallocates
	the memory that was being used by that object and prevents a memory leak. This is not needed in Java coding because Java
	automattically destroys all the objects that are no longer in use in your code.	


5 - Create collection classes using templates in C++
----
TODO: Answer the following questions about templates in C++

* What is the main benefit of using templates when creating collection classes?
* In normal C++ code the .h file contains the declarations, and the .cpp file contains implementations. Explain why this isn't the case with template-based collection classes.

20 - Using time and space analysis, justify the selection of a data structure for a given application
----
TODO: Answer the following questions about choosing data structures. (5 points each)

* If I needed a data structure to store a set of strings, which data structure (or data structures) that we learned this semester would be most appropriate? Carefully explain why. (Remember that a set doesn't have any order, and doesn't store duplicates. We can add items, remove items, and check to see if an item is already in the set.)
* If I needed a data structure to store a grocery list, which data structure (or data structures) that we learned this semester would be most appropriate? Carefully explain why.
* If I needed a data structure to store student records so that I could look students up by Banner number, which data structure (or data structures) that we learned this semester would be most appropriate? Carefully explain why.
* Imagine that I'm implementing a network router. It needs to keep a queue of packets waiting to be sent out over the network, but this queue need a special ability: Different companies are going to pay me different amounts of money, and the packets from the highest paying company should be sent out first. That is, if company X paid 20 and company Y paid 10, then X's packets always get sent before Y's packets. Y only gets to send packets if X doesn't have any waiting. Which data structure (or data structures) that we learned this semester would be most appropriate? Carefully explain why.
