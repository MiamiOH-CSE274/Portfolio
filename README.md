Portfolio
=========
Document completion of the course's learning outcomes.

Instructions
====
The goal of this is to make it very easy for me (or an employer, or a teaching assistant) to see whether or not you have mastered the material of the class. The hope is that I would be able to grade your work without downloading and compiling your code. For labs, I can grade them by inspecting the code. For projects you must provide a video demonstrations of your programs. Some questions require essay responses.

Important
=========
If you prefer, you may turn this in to me via email, instead of hosting it on GitHub. Please talk to me about it during office hours or before or after class.

Body of portfolio

7 - Create an implementation of a Queue
----
https://github.com/richarkc/03_Queue_Lab/blob/master/ArrayQueue.ipp

7 - Create an implementation of a List
----
https://github.com/richarkc/04_Linked_List_Lab/blob/master/LinkedList.h

7 - Create an implementation of a Binary Search Tree
----
TODO: Provide a link to your completed 06_BST_Lab OR ClosestStarbucks project (only if you used a search tree)

7 - Create an implementation of a Hash Table
----
https://github.com/richarkc/05_Hashing_Lab/blob/master/HashTable.h

7 - Create an implementation of a Heap
----
TODO: Provide a link to your completed 07_Heap_Lab OR Vise project (only if you implemented a heap for it)

7 - Create an implementation of either Adjacency Lists or Adjacency Matrices
----
TODO: Provide a link to your completed 08_Graph_Lab OR Vise project (only if you implemented a graph for it)

7 - Implement graph algorithms
----
TODO: Provide a link to your completed Vise project (only if you used graph traversal), or add a graph traversal to 08_Graph_Lab and provide a link

21 - Determine space and time requirements of common data structure methods
-----
TODO: For each pair of data structures listed here, write a short essay comparing and contrasting them in terms of their running times for different operations. (7 points each)

An array based list is faster in finding a specific element in an array and/or modifying a certain element due to its ability to
instantly access any element in the list, and so it can be done in constant time, compared to linear time in a linked list
due to having to actually loop through the list however a linked list will be faster in adding and removing elements and can do it
in constant time due to only having to edit the two elements around it to no longer point to that element, while an array based list must change almost the entire array to add or remove from the middle of the array. 
* Binary Search Tree vs. Hash Table
* Adjacency List vs. Adjacency Matrix

5 - Describe memory management in C++, and correctly use dynamic variables, including destructors
----
TODO: Define/describe each of the following terms, as they apply to memory management in C++

The call stack stores all statically allocated variables and any imformation relating to function calls (return address, parameters). Allows for fast and convenient access of memory.

The heap stores all dynamically allocated memory, i.e. any variables allocated with the new keyword, and requires manual memory management

An address is the physical location of a variable in virtual memory.

A pointer is a variable that stores an address and type of another variable in memory, so that you can pass that specific item around in code.

TODO: Answer the following questions about memory management and dynamic variables

A memory leak is an item in memory that no longer has any pointers to it. It is bad because it is occupying memory space that could be freed, and eventually could overflow your allocated memory and cause a crash.

A dangling pointer is a pointer to a point in memory that has already been deallocated. It is dangerous because you could still access that memory and cause errors, segfaults, and program crashes.

A destructor is a method that is called when an item goes out of scope, and is used to deallocate dynamic memory in that object. It is not necessary in java because java automatically collects that garbage when it goes out of scope.

5 - Create collection classes using templates in C++
----
TODO: Answer the following questions about templates in C++


20 - Using time and space analysis, justify the selection of a data structure for a given application
----
TODO: Answer the following questions about choosing data structures. (5 points each)

* If I needed a data structure to store a set of strings, which data structure (or data structures) that we learned this semester would be most appropriate? Carefully explain why. (Remember that a set doesn't have any order, and doesn't store duplicates. We can add items, remove items, and check to see if an item is already in the set.)

A linked list would be the best data structure to store a grocery list. The reason being is that while shopping, one would have to frequently delete or add specific items within the list, and linkedlist provides the greatest efficiency for it. Also, one would not have to find specific items in the list, as most likely, you would actively want to see the entire list, and not just single specific items, so the speed from using arrays or array lists is not utilized. Finally, the linkedlist also would never need to reallocate space in the event that you add too many items to the list, so it's also most space efficient.

* If I needed a data structure to store student records so that I could look students up by Banner number, which data structure (or data structures) that we learned this semester would be most appropriate? Carefully explain why.
* Imagine that I'm implementing a network router. It needs to keep a queue of packets waiting to be sent out over the network, but this queue need a special ability: Different companies are going to pay me different amounts of money, and the packets from the highest paying company should be sent out first. That is, if company X paid 20 and company Y paid 10, then X's packets always get sent before Y's packets. Y only gets to send packets if X doesn't have any waiting. Which data structure (or data structures) that we learned this semester would be most appropriate? Carefully explain why.
