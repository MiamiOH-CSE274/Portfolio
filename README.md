21 - Determine space and time requirements of common data structure methods
-----
<b>Queue</b> (We did a circular Queue https://github.com/kosirjm/03_Queue_Lab)
              
      Add - Took a time complexity of O(1) typically this is because we were adding the items
            to the next available spot in line.  Since we knew what that was because we knew 
            the number of items, which was kept track of every time we added and removed an item,
            we could simply just add the item to that position without looping through and looking
            for an empty spot.  Still, if the number of items exceeded the size of the list grow()
            had to be called and our time complexity is O(n) since we have to loop through to copy
            all the items in the list to a new temp queue.

      Remove - Took time complexity of O(1), we simply just removed the item from the last spot in the list
               and subtracted one from our number of items counter.

      Grow - Took O(n) time complexity.  This is due to the fact of iterating through the items in the list with
             a for loop to copy them over to a temp array so we could resize the old array.

      Size - Size is an O(10 time complexity.  This is because every time we remove or add an item we have a 
             counter which is incremented appropriately.

                     
<b>Linked List</b> (We did a Doubly-Linked list https://github.com/kosirjm/04_Linked_List_Lab)
                    
        Find - Find is an O(n) complexity for doubly-linked-list it must iterate though all of the items 
               using a loop to see if the item matches the search.  This is of course unless the item is the
               first or last item then it is an O(1).
               
        Set -  Is the same as find O(n) unless it is the first or last item then it is O(1).  This is because you
               must find the item and then add the item which is only O(1).
              
        Add - In our program it was O(n) unless the item was in the first or last position. This is because the find                  function was called to remove a certain index.
              
        Remove - In our program it was O(n) unless the item was in the first or last position. This is because the find                  function was called to remove a certain index.
        
        Size - Was O(1) this is because the number of items was tracked as we added or subtracted the items from the                  list giving us the ability to return the value without counting the items by using a loop.
        
        
<b>Binary Search Tree</b> (https://github.com/kosirjm/06_BST_Lab)
          
       (h = The height of the tree.  In worst case h = n being that all nodes just go one way creating
        an unbalanced tree.  Best case for h is log(n) being that the tree is perfectly balanced)
        
        Add - The time complexity for this is function was O(h).  This is because you must traverse down the 
              tree recursively in the correct path to find the place correct place which equals NULL to input the item. 
        
        Remove - The time complexity for this is function was O(h).  This is because you must traverse down the 
                 tree recursively in the correct direction to find the item which must be remove, which at worst is at                   the very bottom
              
        Prev - The time complexity for this is function was O(h).  This is because you must traverse down the 
               tree recursively in the correct path to find the right function that is less than the key given to you,                 which at worst is at the very bottom
        
        Next - The time complexity for this is function was O(h).  This is because you must traverse down the 
               tree recursively in the correct path to find the right function that is greater than the key given to                   you, which at worst is at the very bottom.
          
        Find - The time complexity for this is function was O(h).  This is because you must traverse down the 
               tree recursively in the correct path to find the right function that is equal to the key given to                       you, which at worst is at the very bottom.
          
        KeyExists - The time complexity for this is function was O(h).  This is because you must traverse down the 
                    tree recursively in the correct path to find the right function that is equal to the key given to                       you, which at worst it does not exist therefor would go all the way to the bottom and reach NULL.
          
        Max - The time complexity for this is function was O(h).  This is because you must traverse down the 
              tree recursively to the farthest item on the right side of the tree.  This function is always O(h)
              because it does not end until it hits NULL.
          
        Min - The time complexity for this is function was O(h).  This is because you must traverse down the 
              tree recursively to the farthest item on the left side of the tree.  This function is always O(h)
              because it does not end until it hits NULL.
      
        Size - This one is the only function in our BST_Lab which is O(n).  This is because we do not store the number'
               of items as we add or remove things but instead, have to count each individual item in the BST.


5 - Describe memory management in C++, and correctly use dynamic variables, including destructors
----

In c++ memory management is very important and 

5 - Create collection classes using templates in C++
----

To demonstrate collection classes using a template we will look at https://github.com/kosirjm/04_Linked_List_Lab.  The best way I saw a template described was as a blue print.  It allows us to be able to set up the class or function to work the way we would like but does not limit us to one type.  It allows us to program generically for many cases! If you look at the linked list lab you will see us referencing and passing in params of type T.  There of course is not a type T in c++, but instead it basically means any type.  T acts as a place holder for what any type we would like to use later.  You can use this class and pass in any type of information string, int, double, and so on.  This makes our code and classes more usable for many different things.  Templates can be used on classes as well as function and just basically helps us create generic code that can work for all data presented to us.  


30 - Using time and space analysis, justify the selection of a data structure for a given application

<b><u>Shuffle Project</u></b>
              <p>For this project two choices of an ADT were given to us at the beginning, a linked list or a queue. In the   next few paragraphs I will talk about what I believe would be the better choice to use. First off they both can easily   be used to implement the structure, or movement, of shuffling a deck, so there is no issues there.  With linked         lists you are able to move, set, add, remove, and find items by a specific index, while in queues you cannot.  These    functions that the linked list offer are not needed.  In shuffling a deck there is no need to do anything to a          specific index or find a specific index.</p>
              <p>With this in mind knowing that we do not need the special abilities that the linked lists give us letâ€™s     look at   the time complexities of both ADTs.  All of the queues functions are of time complexity O(1), this            is of course if that when adding an item the number of items do not exceed the size of the queue, because then the      grow function   is called which is of time complexity O(n).  With this in mind a deck only had 52 cards there will      never be any more then that in the deck.  Therefor in this project using a queue would make it always O(1).             Manipulation of the items in the queue can be hard if you need to change a specific item or add or remove at a          specific index.  In this instance depending on how you would implement the items to shuffle, there should not be too    much resizing and calling certain indexes.</p>
             <p> On the other hand all the functions in our linked list are O(n) except for size() which is O(1).  Linked    lists are much easier to modify certain indexes as well as change the size of the list.  If you were doing   a lot of   that or needed it for whatever reason I would suggest the linked list.  Though if implemented correctly this should     not be needed and therefor the queue would be faster in all instances.  So as you can see the queue is the clear        winner to be chosen in this project.</p>

              
<b><u>Closest Starbucks</u></b>
              <p> To choose an appropriate ADT for the closest Starbucks we must do some digging.  Looking at many different ADTs and doing some research either a BST or K-D tree is suggested to be used.  For this project the most important things are speed of the getNearest,  and the accuracy of getNearest.  Now obviously we can choose many different ADTs which could give us either the most accurate or the fastest, but we want something that is both accurate and fast. To choose the correct one we must do some compare and contrast.</p>
              <p>Now both a BST and a K-D tree are very similar they both for all intent and purposes are trees and work the same way.  The nice thing about K-D trees that BSTs donâ€™t have is the K-D tree has the ability to store dimensions.  It allows us to search for exactly what we need, the closest points.  BSTs cannot do this.  If we were to use a BST we would have to do an approximation to where the closest Starbucks might be. So in terms of accuracy and space the K-D tree wins.  Now since both are trees the  time complexity for the function are the same.  They all will be O(h) accept for the count number of items function which will be O(n). 
              <p> So obviously if you have something that is just as fast and more accurate you would want to use that one.  So in this case the K-D tree would win.  Still, there are some down falls to the K-D tree.  First off it is much more complicated to use.  When it comes to ease of understanding and less work if you are willing to sacrifice accuracy the BST would definitely be the choice to use.  Also if it is a high dimensionality, that is if the dimensionality is k, the number of points in the data, N, should be N > 2^k.  If this is not the case then it will not be accurate and approximation will have to be used anyways.  So if it is high dimensionality you might as well use a BST since approximation is going to have to be used any ways, since the BST is easier to program with.</p>
              <p>So as you can see you should typically use a K-D tree for this type of problem, it allows accuracy as well as speed.  Still, if you are an early programmer and are not comfortable with a K-D tree a BST would be suggested as well if the problem is a high dimensional problem where k is the dimension and n is the number of nodes, if n < 2^k then you might as well use the BST for ease of use because approximation will have to be used anyways.</p>
